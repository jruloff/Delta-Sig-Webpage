Welcome to the homepage of the Alpha Theta chapter of Delta Sigma Phi. We are excited to be on campus at the University of Michigan as of Fall 2014. Our chapter, though young, hopes to better our community through service, brotherhood, and philanthropy. The men of the Alpha Theta chapter are well underway in our efforts to integrate into Greek Life here at the University of Michigan and are eager to see in what ways we can contribute to our campus and community. <br> <br>

The Delta Sigma Phi fraternity is committed to build better men and shape better lives by challenging our members to expand their horizons in the academic, social, and personal realms. We strive to be atypical in our approach to giving back to our community through leadership, action, and integrity. The men of Delta Sigma Phi invite and encourage you to explore our website to see if we are the right fit for you.
